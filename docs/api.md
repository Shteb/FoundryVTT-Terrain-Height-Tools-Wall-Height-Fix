# Terrain Height Tools API

> [!NOTE]
> This page is only relevant to macro, script or module developers that want to integrate with Terrain Height Tools.

Terrain Height Tools exposes an API that can be used by macros, scripts or, other modules. This is available through the
global `terrainHeightTools` property. The following functions are available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From 0.4.7 onwards, a "group" property is available for drawing-related functions. It is strongly recommended to provide a non-default value for this, as it allows isolation between your own scripts/modules, THT's internal drawing, and any other scripts/modules that are drawing rulers. The recommended format is to use the script/module name, e.g. `"my-module"`. You can also use sub-groups, such as by having a group like `"my-module.group1"`.
>
> This property will be ignored in previous versions of THT, so it is safe to add this property without checking THT's API version.

## T:Point3D

Represents a point in 3D space.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`x`|`number`|Position in the X axis measured in canvas pixels.|
|`y`|`number`|Position in the Y axis measured in canvas pixels.|
|`h`|`number`|Height position, measured in arbitrary height values, just as the terrains' heights are.|

## calculateLineOfSight

![Available Since v0.3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available%20Since-v0.3.0-blue?style=flat-square)
![Changed in v0.4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Changed%20In-v0.4.0-orange?style=flat-square)

Computes a line of sight test between two points in 3d space.

Note that this will always return an empty array if the line of sight ray is zero-length, even if the start/end point is within a shape.

### Parameters

|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`p1`|`Point3D`|*Required*|The initial point that the LOS ray should begin from. The `x` and `y` coordinates are measured in pixels relative to the canvas. `h` is measured in an arbitrary unit, just as the terrains' heights are.|
|`p2`|`Point3D`|*Required*|The point that the LOS ray should end. The `x` and `y` coordinates are measured in pixels relative to the canvas. `h` is measured in an arbitrary unit, just as the terrains' heights are.|
|`options`|`Object`|`{}`|Additional options for configuring the calculation.|
|`options.includeNoHeightTerrain`|`boolean`|`false`|If false, any terrain types that are configured as not using a height are excluded from the calculation. If true, these terrains are included, and their height is treated as if it were infinity.|

### Returns

An combined array of distinct regions where a ray drawn from `p1` to `p2` intersects or touches any terrain shapes.
- All regions will have a non-zero length.
- The regions will not overlap.
- There may be gaps _between_ regions if the line of sight ray does not intersect any terrain shape at this position.
- The regions in the array are sorted in order they are encountered along the line of sight ray.
- Each region object has the following properties:

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`start`|`Object`|An object detailing the start of the region.|
|`start.x`|`number`|The X coordinate (in canvas pixels) where the intersection started.|
|`start.y`|`number`|The Y coordinate (in canvas pixels) where the intersection started.|
|`start.h`|`number`|The height where the intersection started.|
|`start.t`|`number`|How far along the line of sight ray the intersection started. Will always be a value between 0 and 1 inclusive. E.G. on a ray that is 100px long, a `t` value of 0.2 would mean that it started 20 pixels along the ray.|
|`end`|`Object`|An object detailing the end of the region.|
|`end.x`|`number`|The X coordinate (in canvas pixels) where the intersection ended.|
|`end.y`|`number`|The Y coordinate (in canvas pixels) where the intersection ended.|
|`end.h`|`number`|The height where the intersection ended.|
|`end.t`|`number`|How far along the line of sight ray the intersection ended. Will always be a value between 0 and 1 inclusive. E.G. on a ray that is 200px long, a `t` value of 0.3 would mean that it ended 60 pixels along the ray.|
|`shapes`|`HeightMapShape[]`|An array of the shape(s) that were intersected at this region.|
|`skimmed`|`boolean`|If `true`, this region is an area where the line of sight ray touches but does not completely enter the shape. This will also be the case if the line of sight ray is flat and the shape is the height of the ray. For example a ray where p1.h = 1 and p2.h = 2 intersecting a height 1 object will always result in a skim. If `false`, the ray has completely entered the shape.|

### Examples

```js
// Run the calculation
const result = terrainHeightTools.calculateLineOfSight({ x: 200, y: 100, h: 1 }, { x: 300, y: 400, h: 2 });

// Example: Check to see if there are any intersections?
const anyIntersections = result.length > 0;

// Example: Check to see if there are any intersections, excluding skimming ones:
const anyIntersectionsNoSkimming = result.some(r => !r.skimmed);

// Example: Check to see if it has intersected with a specific type of terrain.
const hardCoverTerrainType = terrainHeightTools.getTerrainType({ name: "Hard Cover" });
const hasIntersectedWithHardCover = result.some(r => r.shapes.some(s => s.terrainTypeId === hardCoverTerrainType.id));
```

## calculateLineOfSightByShape

![Available Since v0.3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available%20Since-v0.3.0-blue?style=flat-square)

A more verbose version of `calculateLineOfSight`. Takes the same parameters but returns the intersections grouped by the shape that it occured on.

Regions are not merged with other shapes' regions, so in a case where two different shapes are touching and the line of sight ray skims between the two, this function will be able to detail both, whereas `calculateLineOfSight` would only show one.

In most cases, `calculateLineOfSight` is an easier function to use.

Note that this will always return an empty array if the line of sight ray is zero-length, even if the start/end point is within a shape.

### Parameters

|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`p1`|`Point3D`|*Required*|The initial point that the LOS ray should begin from. The `x` and `y` coordinates are measured in pixels relative to the canvas. `h` is measured in an arbitrary unit, just as the terrains' heights are.|
|`p2`|`Point3D`|*Required*|The point that the LOS ray should end. The `x` and `y` coordinates are measured in pixels relative to the canvas. `h` is measured in an arbitrary unit, just as the terrains' heights are.|
|`options`|`Object`|`{}`|Additional options for configuring the calculation.|
|`options.includeNoHeightTerrain`|`boolean`|`false`|If false, any terrain types that are configured as not using a height are excluded from the calculation. If true, these terrains are included, and their height is treated as if it were infinity.|

|`shape.terrainTypeId`|`string`|The terrain type ID of the shape that was intersected.|
|`region`|`Array`|An array of intersection regions with this shape. See below.|

The `regions` array is an array of objects.
- All regions will have a non-zero length.
- The regions will not overlap.
- There may be gaps _between_ regions if the line of sight ray does not intersect the terrain shape at this position.
- The regions in the array are sorted in order they are encountered along the line of sight ray.
- Each region object has the following properties:

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`start`|`Object`|An object detailing the start of the region.|

|`skimmed`|`boolean`|If `true`, this region is an area where the line of sight ray touches but does not completely enter the shape. This will also be the case if the line of sight ray is flat and the shape is the height of the ray. For example a ray where p1.h = 1 and p2.h = 2 intersecting a height 1 object will always result in a skim. If `false`, the ray has completely entered the shape.|

## calculateLineOfSightRaysBetweenTokens

![Available Since v0.3.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available%20Since-v0.3.3-blue?style=flat-square)

Calculates the pairs of points to calculate line of sight rays between two tokens. These can then be used with other
functions such as [calculateLineOfSight](#calculatelineofsight).

### Parameters

|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`token1`|`Token`|*Required*|The first token (to calculate the points from).|
|`token2`|`Token`|*Required*|The second token (to calculate the points to).|
|`options`|`Object`|`{}`|Additional options for configuring the points.|
|`options.token1RelativeHeight`|`number \| undefined`|`undefined`|How far the rays end vertically, relative to the height of `token1`. For example: a value of 0 would start the ray at the bottom of the token (h = token's elevation); 1 would start the ray at the top of the token (h = token's elevation + token's size); 0.5 would start the ray half way up the token (h = token's elevation + 0.5 * token's size). If undefined, then this defaults to whatever the value has been configued to at the world-scope by the GM.|
|`options.token2RelativeHeight`|`number \| undefined`|`undefined`|How far the rays end vertically, relative to the height of `token2`. For example: a value of 0 would end the ray at the bottom of the token (h = token's elevation); 1 would end the ray at the top of the token (h = token's elevation + token's size); 0.5 would end the ray half way up the token (h = token's elevation + 0.5 * token's size). If undefined, then this defaults to whatever the value has been configued to at the world-scope by the GM.|

### Returns

An object containing 3 properties: `left`, `centre` and `right`. `left` and `right` are relative to the lines between token1 and token2. In other words: imagine yourself standing at the centre of token1 and looking at the centre of token 2. The `left` ray would be on your left and the `right` ray would be on your right.

|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`left`|`{ p1: Point3D; p2: Point3D; }`|The start and end points of a ray between the left-most point of `token1` and the left-most point of `token2`.|
|`centre`|`{ p1: Point3D; p2: Point3D; }`|The start and end points of a ray between the centre of `token1` and the centre of `token2`.|
|`right`|`{ p1: Point3D; p2: Point3D; }`|The start and end points of a ray between the right-most point of `token1` and the right-most point of `token2`.|

### Examples

```js
// Eample: Fetch the user's controlled token and the one that they are targetting and calculate the rays between them.
// (Note that you should add checks to ensure these tokens are defined, but for brevity that is not done here)
const controlledToken = canvas.tokens.controlled[0];
const targetedToken = game.user.targets.first();
const { left, centre, right } = terrainHeightTools.calculateLineOfSightRaysBetweenTokens(controlledToken, targetedToken, {
	token1RelativeHeight: 0,
	token2RelativeHeight: 1
});

// Example: draw the lines of sight between these two tokens
// (Note: can also use drawLineOfSightRaysBetweenTokens to achieve this same effect)
terrainHeightTools.drawLineOfSightRays([
	{ p1: left.p1, p2: left.p2, showLabels: false },
	{ p1: centre.p1, p2: centre.p2, showLabels: true },
	{ p1: right.p1, p2: right.p2, showLabels: false },
]);

// Example: Test if all lines of sight are broken by 'Hard Cover' terrain.
const hardCoverId = terrainHeightTools.getTerrainType({ name: "Hard Cover" }).id;
const isBlockedByHardCover = [left, centre, right].every(ray =>
	terrainHeightTools.calculateLineOfSight(ray.p1, ray.p2).some(region =>
		region.terrainTypeId === hardCoverId));

// Example: draw the lines of sight between these two tokens, but drawing the line of sight at ground level regardless of token size and elevation
terrainHeightTools.drawLineOfSightRays([
	{ p1: { ...left.p1, h: 0 }, p2: { ...left.p2, h: 0 }, showLabels: false },
	{ p1: { ...centre.p1, h: 0 }, p2: { ...centre.p2, h: 0 }, showLabels: true },

## paintCells

![Available Since v0.1.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available%20Since-v0.1.4-blue?style=flat-square)
![Changed in v0.4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Changed%20In-v0.4.0-orange?style=flat-square)

Paints new terrain data onto the specified cells.

Users must have permissions to update the scene to use this.

### Parameters

|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`cells`|`[number, number][]`|*Required*|An array of cells to paint with new terrain data. Each element in the array should be a pair of numbers representing the X and Y coordinates of a cell. Note that these are grid coordinates, not pixel coordinates. The cells do not have to be adjacent.|
|`terrain`|`Object`|*Required*|Terrain data to apply to the specified cells. Either `id` or `name` must be provided.|
|`terrain.id`|`string`|`undefined`|If provided, will attempt to find a terrain type with this ID.
|`terrain.name`|`string`|`undefined`|If provided, will attempt to find a terrain type with this name. Note that this is case-sensitive. If multiple terrain types have the same name, the first will be returned.|
|`terrain.height`|`number`|`undefined`|The height of the terrain to paint onto the scene. Required when the specified terrain type uses height, ignored if the terrain type does not.|
|`terrain.elevation`|`number`|`undefined`|The elevation of the terrain to paint onto the scene (how heigh it is off the ground). Defaults to 0 when the specified terrain type uses height, ignored if the terrain type does not.|
|`options`|`Object`|`{}`||
|`options.mode`|`"totalReplace" \| "destructiveMerge" \| "additiveMerge"`|`"totalReplace"`|How to handle existing terrain: `"totalReplace"` - Completely overwrites all existing terrain data in the cells with the new data; `"additiveMerge"` - Merges the new terrain data with the existing data, without removing any overlapping terrain.; `"destructiveMerge"` - Merges the new terrain data with the existing data, removing existing overlapping terrain.|

### Returns

A `Promise<boolean>` that will resolve when the data has been saved to the scene. The boolean that is returned will indicate whether or not any changes were made to the terrain map.

### Example
```js
await terrainHeightTools.paintCells([
	[0, 1],
	[1, 1],
	[2, 1],
	[10, 10]
], {
	name: "Hard Cover",
	height: 2
});
```
